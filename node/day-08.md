|Stateful vs Stateless server                       |A Stateful server remember client data (state) from one request to the next. Stateful servers, do store session state.  They may, therefore, keep track of which clients have opened which files, current read and write pointers for files, which files have been locked by which clients, etc. Using a Stateful server,file server, the client can send less data with each request. Better performance and provide locking services  A Stateless server keeps no state information.Stateless file servers do not store any session state.  This means that every client request is treated independently, and not as a part of a new or existing session.  Using a stateless file server, the client must,specify complete file names in each request specify location for reading or writing re-authenticate for each request Easily recover from failure Easy to implement|
