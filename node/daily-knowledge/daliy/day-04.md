|HTTP request                                       |Protocol between client and server to send data Sending data is Message Client -> server is request Server -> client is response HTTPS -> HTTP plus security                                                                                                             |
|GET request                                        |is a HTTP method Request line: - request method GET - request resource path (URL) - request protocol and version (HTTPS/1.1) Request header - key: value pairs - Specify data format, decoding, language, connection (keep-alive), cookies (prevent mallicious attack)....|
|Connection keep alive                              |Connection stays until the windows closed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|POST request                                       |is a HTTP method Request line (Similar to GET) Request header (Similar to GET) Request body: - Encapsulate related information into a request body - Could be key: value pair, JSON, Java object - GET can also has request body but uncommon                            |
|BATCH/PUT request                                  |HTTP method used for updating BATCH: allows to update a specific column of a row PUT: update entire row of the record (less efficient than BATCH)                                                                                                                        |

|HTTP Status Code                                   |Response status of the server - Information response (100 level) - Successful response (200 level)   - Redirection message (300 level) : to redirect request from the old server to the new server - Client response error (400) : error occurs from client's side (invalid input, failing identification) - Server response error (500) : error occurs from server's side (Bad gateway, Gateway timeout)|
|JSP                                                |Java Server Pages Hybrid between HTML and Java Harder to develop and debug Not scalable (Backend and frontend can not be splited) Outdated                                                                                                                               |

|Web server vs application server                   |Web server: deliver static content, content is deliver using http potocol, serves only web base application, does not support multi threading Application server: deliver dynamic content, content is delivered using several protocol (http included), can serves web base and enterprise based application, support multi thread for handling multiple requests in parallel|
