|JDBC Driver                                        |Software component enable java application to interact with database (bridge between Java app and the database)                                                                                                                                                          |
|JDBC program steps                                 |1. Allocate a connection object for connecting to the database 2. Allocate a statement object based on the connection 3. Write SQL query, execute query 4. Process the query result 5. Close the statement and connection object to free up resources                    |
|JDBC methods                                       |DriverManager.getConnection(), createStatement(), executeQuery(), Resultset.next(), close()                                                                                                                                                                              |
|CRUD operation                                     |Create (INSERT) Read (SELECT) Update Delete                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|commit &#124; rollback                                  |setAutoCommit to false Connection.commit() Connection.rollback() Usually rollback is used in the catch block                                                                                                                                                             |
|SQL Injection                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|PreparedStatement                                  |Prevent SQL Injection. Strictly validate all the inputs Faster than createStatement because it is precompiled                                                                                                                                                            |
|Batch statements                                   |Execute multiple SQL query by using batch addBatch() executeBatch() -> return array of int More efficient because we can send multiple queries to the database with only one send                                                                                        |
|Statement vs PreparedStatement vs CallableStatement|Statement: used to execute normal sql query, prefered when we want to execute one particular query PreparedStatement: used to execute parameterized on dynamic sql query, prefered when we wants to execute multiple queries CallableStatement: used for closed procedure|
|ORM                                                |Build relationship between columns in the database with the fields in Java objects                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|Hibernate                                          |Object-relational mapping (ORM) tool. Framework Does not have to write SQL query Common in enterprise environment                                                                                                                                                        |
|JDBC vs Hibernate                                  |JDBC: tight couple, have to update all the queries if DBMS change, faster Hibernate: loose couple, does not have to change queries when DBMS change, slower                                                                                                              |
