|Servlet Architecture                               |Servlet interface -> HttpServlet class -> Customized Servlet class                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|Servlet life cycle                                 |Constructor -> init -> service execution -> destroy                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|RequestDispatcher                                  |Rounting requests between Servlets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|forward() vs SendRedirect()                        |forward():  happen internally within the server faster URL does not change Same request is forwarded SendRedirect(): Involve client slower Result in URL changes Making a new request                                                                                    |
|Java Reflection                                    |Reflection is an API which is used to examine or modify the behavior of methods, classes, interfaces at runtime 1. Get the class template (Class object = Object.class) 2. Get the constructor (object.getConstructor()) 3. Get the fields (object.getDeclaredField()) 4. Get the method (object.getDeclaredMethod())|
|Singleton Pattern                                  |What: class that can only have one object How: make constructor private, using static methods Examples: access control of resource (database connection, socket), Action Servlet, Service Locator Eager loading: object creation takes place at load time (create new instance on the static field) Lazy loading: object creation is done if needed (new instance is created in getInstance() method with null check)|
|Proxy Pattern                                      |What: provide control of accessing original object and hide the complexity of that object How: create a proxy class that implements the same interface of the original class. Instantiate orignal object in the proxy class field Examples: Spring AOP                   |
|Factory Pattern                                    |We create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface. Hide object creation logic from user                                                                                                      |
|Builder Pattern                                    |The builder pattern is a design pattern that allows for the step-by-step creation of complex objects using the correct sequence of actions Separate the construction of complex object from its representation Can build immutable object Reduce the number of parameter |
|Static programming                                 |Compile the code -> cannot change class or field after compiling Cannot change method Cannot have different field                                                                                                                                                        |
